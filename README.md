Personal Landing Page Draft/boilerplate

This is a quick -but not so quick- template for when i want to create something for personal use in the future...
note: it didn't actually take me that long in general, it's just that there were a couple of issue that made me almost want to throw my laptop out of the window... issue one was solved in 2 minutes after i slept on it; i forgot that setting padding exists! (also i had too many nested flexboxes, one of them was absolutely redundant ). The second, was resolved by concluding that the feature is only feasible with js... although i might be wrong, but hey, i am exhausted! (i was looking for a way to get the code to size the image in the hero to match the dimensions of the text content next to it... ended up adjusting it manually after playing with the image's aspect ratio -and changing the image cuz the first one looked really sad with the butchered aspect!-)
